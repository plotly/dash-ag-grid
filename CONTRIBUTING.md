# Dash AG Grid Contributing Guide

Dash AG Grid welcomes community contributions!

If you have identified a bug or have an idea for a new feature, it's best to start with a GitHub issue. First look at existing issues at https://github.com/plotly/dash-ag-grid/issues to make sure this is not a duplicate. Then create a new issue. Bug reports should be accompanied by a small example app that someone else can copy and run to reproduce the problem.

If you have questions, please ask on the [Dash Community Forum](https://community.plotly.com/). rather than using GitHub issues.


### Developing in this repo

Make sure you have Dash installed with dev and testing extras:
```
pip install dash[dev,testing]
```
Build the component (from the root of this repo):
```
npm i
npm run build
```
Now install the component in development mode:
```
$ pip install -e .
```
In development mode, Python uses the files in this directory when you import the package. So you can write a testing app in another folder, and whenever you change some code and rebuild the component here it will update in your testing app.

### Versioning
We follow a strict versioning system aligned with the underlying Ag Grid version, but also reserving the
patch number for updates to the Dash grid.

Specifically, Dash Ag Grid will always have the same _major_ and _minor_ version number as the Javascript Ag Grid package it is bundling, but it may not always have the same patch number.

Ag Grid releases new major versions every 6-8 months, and minor versions every 4-6 weeks. Sometimes, Dash Ag Grid may introduce new changes that warrant a minor release according to [semver](https://semver.org/): For example, exposing a functional property of Ag Grid as a declarative property in Dash Ag Grid. In this case, we would wait for a new minor release of Ag Grid and bump the versions together.

We may release out-of-band of Ag Grid when there are patches that we want to make available.

As a user, you can always check the underlying Ag Grid version with `dash_ag_grid.grid_version` and the underlying Dash Ag Grid version with `dash_ag_grid.__version__`.

For maintainers, when issuing new releases ensure that the version bump of Dash Ag Grid follows this convention.

### Create a production build

Update the package version in `package.json` and `CHANGELOG.md` and ensure the changelog lists all the important updates. Then reinstall (so `package-lock.json` gets the new version) and rebuild:
```
npm i
npm run build
```

Commit this - either via a PR or directly to the main branch. Then you can create source and wheel distributions in the generated `dist/` folder, after emptying out any previous builds:
```
rm -rf dist build
python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
```
See [PyPA](https://packaging.python.org/guides/distributing-packages-using-setuptools/#packaging-your-project)
for more information. At this point you can test the build. The best way is to make a virtual env in another directory, install the wheel you just built, and run one of the demo apps, something like:
```
cd ../my_test
python -m venv venv
. venv/bin/activate
pip install -e ".[dev, docs]"
```

And run the tests:
```
pytest
```

Create a new distribution with:
```
npm run dist
```

It doesn't need to be tested extensively, just enough to know that the table loads with no errors and you've built the right version of the code. If the app looks good, use [`twine`](https://pypi.org/project/twine/) to upload these to PyPI:
```
# back in the dash-ag-grid directory
twine upload dist/*
```
Now you can go back to the test directory, install from PyPI, ensure you get the expected version, and test again:
```
pip uninstall dash-ag-grid
pip install dash-ag-grid
python demo_stock_portfolio.py
```

We also publish the JavaScript build to NPM, so `unpkg` has the bundles if users set `serve_locally=False`. First make a test of the NPM package, verify that its contents are reasonable:
```
npm pack
```
Then publish:
```
npm publish
```
Now create a git tag:
```
git tag -a 'v31.0,1' -m 'v31.0.1'
git push --tags
```
And create a new [GitHub release](https://github.com/plotly/dash-ag-grid/releases) linked to this tag, titled the same as the tag name (`v31.0.1` etc), with the exact changelog entry for this release as the description, and attach the built packages (both files in the `dist/` folder) to the release.

Lastly, announce the release in Slack, in both the `#dash-product` and `#community-ag-grid` channels. You're done!
