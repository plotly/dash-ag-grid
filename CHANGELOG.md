### Fixed
- [210](https://github.com/plotly/dash-ag-grid/pull/210) Fix issue with `columnState` and React 18

### Updated
- [210](https://github.com/plotly/dash-ag-grid/pull/210) Migrate props that use `setProps` from the `render()` to `componentDidUpdate`

## [2.1.0] - 2023-06-02

### Added
- [#201](https://github.com/plotly/dash-ag-grid/pull/201) Add `cellDoubleClicked` prop, which works exactly like `cellClicked`

### Updated
- [#174](https://github.com/plotly/dash-ag-grid/pull/174)
  - `columnState` floats during grid interaction and only gets pushed when sent in a callback
  - `columnDefs` trumps `columnState` if it is pushed in a callback without a `columnState`

- [#207](https://github.com/plotly/dash-ag-grid/pull/207) Update AG Grid from 29.3.3 to 29.3.5, with a few minor bugfixes, see their changelog for [29.3.4](https://www.ag-grid.com/changelog/?fixVersion=29.3.4) and [29.3.5](https://www.ag-grid.com/changelog/?fixVersion=29.3.5). Also other minor dependency updates.

### Fixed
- [#174](https://github.com/plotly/dash-ag-grid/pull/174) Fix [#171](https://github.com/plotly/dash-ag-grid/issues/171): `Markdown` renderer now displays a blank cell rather than writing `undefined` if there is no value

Fix by adding `timestamp` into the object, as we have in other event-type props to make them unique.

## [2.0.0] - 2023-05-02

### Removed

  - Add `className` prop for css customization native to AG Grid
  - Add `enable*` props for easier user / dash manipulation, for creating buttons

  - Allow for `null` to be passed to `columnSize`, to prevent the fit to width or autosize being the only options

- [#28](https://github.com/plotly/dash-ag-grid/pull/28)
  - Allow for other column prop functions to pass without disabling them if `dangerously_allow_code` is not passed

  - Column attributes `cellClass`, `cellStyle`, and `cellClassRules`

- [#67](https://github.com/plotly/dash-ag-grid/pull/67) Function parsing recursive columnDefs
  - Add more functions to be available for parsing
  - Allow for recursively going through `columnDefs` -> `children` and master detail info

- [#45](https://github.com/plotly/dash-ag-grid/pull/45) Fix [#44](https://github.com/plotly/dash-ag-grid/issues/44), markdown ignoring `target="_blank"` to open links in a new tab. Now if `dangerously_use_code` is `false`, markdown cells honor `columnDef.linkTarget`, but if `dangerously_use_code` is `true` you MUST use the HTML syntax `<a target="_blank">` to achieve this, markdown syntax `[text](url)` will ignore `columnDef.linkTarget`.

  - Fix `paginationGoTo` to work with a starting page
