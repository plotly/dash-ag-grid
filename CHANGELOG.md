## [2.0.0]

### Removed

- [Overhaul commit](https://github.com/plotly/dash-ag-grid/commit/b888d6ab4fcb4afac187492e8b6c9cf0d0f8842b)
  - Remove `agGridColumns` component due to deprecation in AG Grid v29
  - Remove some hardcoded CSS

### Added

- [Overhaul commit](https://github.com/plotly/dash-ag-grid/commit/b888d6ab4fcb4afac187492e8b6c9cf0d0f8842b)
  - Add `className` prop for css customization native to ag-grid
  - Add `enable*` props for easier user / dash manipulation, for creating buttons
  - Add overarching `dangerously_allow_code` prop to grid props only provided at render, to keep `columnDefs` from receiving possible updates to execute malicious JavaScript (originally called `dangerously_allow_html` but renamed later)
  - Add `data_previous` and `data_previous_timestamp` props to allow easier change tracking in callbacks
  - Add `dashGridOptions` prop to allow for arbitrary use of AG Grid props not explicitly listed
  - Add `setRowId` prop to allow `rowData` change detection
  - Add `columnState` prop to retrieve the current state of the columns after user interaction

- [#6](https://github.com/plotly/dash-ag-grid/pull/6)
  - Allow strings of functions to be passed as parameters to `valueGetterFunction`, `valueFormatterFunction`. This allows for functions to be parsed even in a strict CSP environment.
  - Add row conditional formatting via `getRowStyle`, acts similar to `cellStyles`
  - Add ability for custom parsing functions to be passed via the namespace `window.dashAgGridFunctions`
  - Allow for `null` to be passed to `columnSize`, to prevent the fit to width or autosize being the only options

- [#28](https://github.com/plotly/dash-ag-grid/pull/28)
  - allowed for other column prop functions to pass without disabling them if `dangerously_allow_code` is not passed
  - copying over `columnDef` `dangerously_allow_code` to allow for the prop to be placed only on the grid level
  - created a unified function parser to be easier to maintain
  - brought the props to iterate through into a separate js `utils/functionVars.js` file
  - switched to keeping `params` together instead of splitting into separate keys, to allow for easier transition to using AG Grid docs
  - updated `test/test_add_remove_update_rows.py` to apply the new variable configuration

- [#39](https://github.com/plotly/dash-ag-grid/pull/39)
  - Allowed for `defaultColDef` to be iterated through for functions
  - Added `tooltipComponent` to be altered if it was list as a function object
  - Added tests for `custom_components.py`, and made it so the stock data is pulled from a csv instead of live.

- [#49](https://github.com/plotly/dash-ag-grid/pull/49) Safely handle more attributes when `dangerously_allow_code` is disabled: top-level attributes `rowClassRules`, `getRowStyle`, and `getRowClass`; and column attributes `cellClass`, `cellStyle`, and `cellClassRules`.

- [#67](https://github.com/plotly/dash-ag-grid/pull/67) Function parsing recursvie columndefs
  - adding more functions to be available for parsing
  - allowed for recursively going through `columnDefs` -> `children` and master detail info
  - added various tests for functionality

- [#76](https://github.com/plotly/dash-ag-grid/pull/76) Adding logging function
  - adding logging function available by default, available via `{"function": "log()"}`

- [#81](https://github.com/plotly/dash-ag-grid/pull/81)
  - added tests for `cellClicked` data

### Updated
- [Overhaul commit](https://github.com/plotly/dash-ag-grid/commit/b888d6ab4fcb4afac187492e8b6c9cf0d0f8842b)
  - Update AG Grid from v27.x to v29.x - see [AG Grid Changelog](https://www.ag-grid.com/changelog/) for details.
  - Update markdown renderer to use github markdown, and also have the ability to be passed a target for links, to avoid `dangerously_allow_code`
  - Update `requirements.txt` (Python dependencies for demos and docs) to allow the latest packages

- [#39](https://github.com/plotly/dash-ag-grid/pull/39)
  - Changing `selectionChanged` to `selectedRows` to make props align with AG Grid.
  - Document adjustments for `selectionChanged` to `selectedRows`, also allowed for persistence in the `selectedRows`

- [#70](https://github.com/plotly/dash-ag-grid/pull/70)
  - Changing `clickData` to `cellRendererData` to more closely line up with what this does

- [#81](https://github.com/plotly/dash-ag-grid/pull/81)
  - prop clean-up overhaul
  - updating testing that broke due to props no longer being on the grid, but in dashGridOptions
  - added testing for selection and sizing buttons
  - removed `cellStyle` from the grid level, allowing more flexibility in customization, and alignment with AG grid
  - allowed for functions, styleConditions and regular dictionaries to be passed to the `cellStyle` on all levels
  - added `rowId` to `cellClicked` data

### Fixed
- [Overhaul commit](https://github.com/plotly/dash-ag-grid/commit/b888d6ab4fcb4afac187492e8b6c9cf0d0f8842b)
  - Fix issue where conditional formatting was not applied to nested columns
  - Fix issue where columns would not take edits or adjustments due to becoming static

- [#6](https://github.com/plotly/dash-ag-grid/pull/6) Fix props issue for `enableAddRows`
- [#19](https://github.com/plotly/dash-ag-grid/pull/19) Fixed `cellClicked` as reported in [#17](https://github.com/plotly/dash-ag-grid/issues/17)
- [#45](https://github.com/plotly/dash-ag-grid/pull/45) Fix [#44](https://github.com/plotly/dash-ag-grid/issues/44), markdown ignoring `target="_blank"` to open links in a new tab. Now if `dangerously_use_code` is `false`, markdown cells honor `columnDef.linkTarget`, but if `dangerously_use_code` is `true` you MUST use the HTML syntax `<a target="_blank">` to achieve this, markdown syntax `[text](url)` will ignore `columnDef.linkTarget`.
- [#47](https://github.com/plotly/dash-ag-grid/pull/47) Fix `virtualRowData` by setting the default `rowModelType='clientSide'`
- [#81](https://github.com/plotly/dash-ag-grid/pull/81) Fixing syncing issue with `rowData`, `virtualRowData` when cell edits and async `rowTransactions` occur
- [#90](https://github.com/plotly/dash-ag-grid/pull/90) Fixing `columnState` to be populated once `gridReady`
- [#92](https://github.com/plotly/dash-ag-grid/pull/92) Fixing `defaultStyle` when no `styleConditions` is in `cellStyle`
